## 1. Visualise

### 1.1 
**The purpose of this task is to evaluate the thought process behind creating and evaluating data visualization**

The reason and the thought process behind creating this data visualisation is to see various factors affecting mortality and illness. 
Predominantly, here mosquito has been taken into consideration as the `source` of infection, and analysis has been done.

> This diseases list was not made taking ONLY mosquito into consideration but their affect on diseases is too massive to be ignored 

There are 4 stories in this data which take us through the whole dashboard and covers almost everything that the data has to offer.

1. Media Coverage 
2. Contagiousness 
3. Deadliness 
4. Mosquito

### 1.2
**You may also submit a document praising the visualization and also detailing its shortcomings**

**Praises**

1. Deaths per year from various animals

As simple it may look, but this is my favourite visualisation because it shows the comparative study and also uses shape size to be another visualisation determining the no. of deaths

2. The disease category segregation based on the symbol adjacent to the name of the disease and the color of the symbol helps in knowing the type of the dieases or where it affects.
3. Proper legend and documentation with floating description for each and every disease.
4. Categorial encoding in`x_axis` variables is really interesting, gives a very humanly feel to the data. However, it is present for `y_axis` too but we are more tuned to see values in `y_axis` rather than `x_axis`.

**Suggestions**

1. Maybe we could summarise the visualization by using color and size gradient for the level of contagiousness or death
2.
